I am a full stack developer who loves solving problems using code.

The technologies that I currently have under my belt include JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, Git, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and python.

I also have the experience of building Progressive Web Applications.

I also enjoy writing. I regularly post articles about stuff related to web development on my blog.
